Key insights from the dashboard include:

Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn rates compared to long-term contracts.

Short-tenure customers are more likely to churn, particularly within the first 12 months.

A disproportionate share of revenue at risk is driven by a relatively small segment of high-value customers.

Certain service combinations show stronger correlations with churn than others.

## Page 1: Executive Overview
This page provides a high-level summary of customer churn and revenue impact. KPIs such as churn rate, retention rate, ARPU, and revenue at risk allow stakeholders to quickly assess overall business health.

Key observations:
- Churn is concentrated among short-tenure, month-to-month customers.
- Revenue at risk is materially lower for long-term contracts despite higher customer counts.

## Page 2: Churn Drivers & Segmentation
This page explores the factors most strongly associated with churn, including contract type, tenure, and service subscriptions.

Key observations:
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate across all tenure groups.
- Customers with fewer bundled services are more likely to churn.
- Payment method and contract flexibility appear to influence churn behaviour.

## Page 3: Revenue & Customer Value
This page focuses on financial impact, highlighting ARPU, high-value churners, and estimated customer lifetime value.

Key observations:
- High-value churners represent a small portion of customers but account for a large share of revenue at risk.
- Longer tenure significantly increases estimated CLTV.
