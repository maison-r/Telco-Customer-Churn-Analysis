Power BI Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of customer churn behaviour, revenue risk, and customer segmentation. It is designed to support both high-level executive decision-making and deeper exploratory analysis.

Key insights from the dashboard include:

Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn rates compared to long-term contracts.

Short-tenure customers are more likely to churn, particularly within the first 12 months.

A disproportionate share of revenue at risk is driven by a relatively small segment of high-value customers.

Certain service combinations show stronger correlations with churn than others.
